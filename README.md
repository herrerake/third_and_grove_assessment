  Third and Grove Front End Developer Assessment
</h1>

## 🚀 Quick Notes

1.  **Gatsby.js as the front end**

    Given the requirement to use React and the job description asking for Gatsby I thought Gatsby would be the perfect technology.

2.  **Randomuser Gatsby Plugin**

    This plugin made it really easy to pull data from the randomuser API using graphql. Sweet! 

3.  **The Sass requirement**

    Given this requirement I opted to use flexbox and not rely on any css frameworks such as bootstrap.

4.  **Accordion**

    The accordion was the most fun part of the assignment. Plus I got flex react hooks skills 💪🏽
